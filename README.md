# strawberrymusicplayer-releases
These are builds of the excellent Strawberry Music Player that I make for my own personal use.  I put them here for my own ease of access.

## Strawberry Music Player Official Sites
* Website: https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/
* Repository: https://github.com/strawberrymusicplayer/strawberry

## Important Notes
Regarding the builds found here...
* They are made with the code from the tagged releases as found in official repository with no changes by me
* They are only for the non-Linux platforms that I use:
    * macOS x64
    * Windows x64
* They work for me but have no real testing:
    * I use the macOS x64 build daily
    * I use the Windows x64 build very infrequently
* They follow no set release schedule - I make them for new official releases when I have time
* They come with no support by me and no support by the official project

If you have any problems with these builds or require a build for a different platform, please refer to the official site: https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/#download
